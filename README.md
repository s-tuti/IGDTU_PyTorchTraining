# IGDTU_PyTorchTraining

It is a project focused on training sessions conducted at IGDTUW (Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women) aimed at learning and applying PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework. Participants gain hands-on experience in implementing neural networks, exploring advanced techniques in machine learning, and applying them to real-world datasets.

## Contents

- **`lectures/`**: Directory containing lecture slides and materials.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks with practical exercises and code examples.
- **`datasets/`**: Sample datasets used in the training sessions.
- **`README.md`**: This file providing an overview of the repository.

## Topics Covered

- Introduction to PyTorch and its ecosystem.
- Building and training neural networks.
- Advanced topics in deep learning (e.g., CNNs, RNNs).
- Applications of PyTorch in image classification, natural language processing, etc.

## Getting Started

To access the training materials:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/s-tuti/IGDTU_PyTorchTraining.git
   cd IGDTU_PyTorchTraining
   ```

2. Explore the directories for lectures, notebooks, and datasets.

3. Open the Jupyter notebooks in `notebooks/` to follow along with the practical exercises.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebook
- Google Colab
- Documentations

Ensure you have these dependencies installed to run the notebooks locally.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the training materials or add new exercises are welcome. Please fork the repository, create a new branch, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
